## PriCE: Privacy-Preserving and Cost-Effective Scheduling for Parallelizing the Large Medical Image Processing Workflow over Hybrid Clouds 


Running deep neural networks for large medical images is a resource-hungry and time-consuming task with centralized computing. While outsourcing such medical image processing tasks to hybrid clouds has benefits, such as a significant reduction of execution time and monetary cost, due to privacy concerns, it is still challenging to process sensitive medical images over clouds, which would hinder their deployment in many real-world applications. To overcome this, we first formulate the overall optimization objectives of the privacy-preserving distributed system model, i.e., minimizing the amount of information about the private data learned by the adversaries throughout the process, reducing the maximum execution time and cost under the user budget constraint. We propose a novel privacy-preserving and cost-effective solution called PriCE to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. We performed extensive simulation experiments for artifact detection tasks on medical images using an ensemble of five deep convolutional neural network inferences as the workflow task. Experimental results show that PriCE successfully splits a wide range of input gigapixel medical images with graph-coloring-based strategies, yielding desired output utility and lowering the privacy risk, maximum completion time, and monetary cost under the maximum total cost.

It is worthy noting that  the results shown here are in whole or part based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network: `https://www.cancer.gov/tcga`\footnote{\url{https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga/using-tcga-data/citing}}. The original Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are protected from the TCGA copyrights, more details please check the website\footnote{Using TCGA data. \url{https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga/using-tcga-data}}. Therefore, the authors are not be able to share the original WSI but instead share patches or give links to the original TCGA repository with the names of the files. In our case, we used `TCGA-E9-A1N3-01Z-00-DX1' to present the research. 

Download the Whole Slide Image (WSI) named `TCGA-E9-A1N3-01Z-00-DX1' from the TCGA research network. 
The original WSI is available on the TCGA repository\footnote{TCGA SLIDE IMAGE VIEWER for the WSI named TCGA-E9-A1N3-01Z-00-DX1. \url{https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/image-viewer/MultipleImageViewerPage?caseId=03c143e0-d8a1-4d60-a4a3-df0501fc6b6e}} and place it at the unzipped folder ``/PriCE/dataset/1WSI/data/''

#### Environment setup

Use the terminal for the following steps:

1. Create the environment from the `environment.yml` file:

    ```conda env create -f environment.yml```
2. Activate the new environment: ```conda activate mytorch```

3. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:

    ```conda env list```
